		<h1>About Me</h1>

			<p>I'm a freelancer, living in Dallas but I'm moving to NYC in October. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because it seems like an exciting field that combines creative design with technical skills.</p>

		<h2>My Mission</h2>

			<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to, one day, work as a junior designer with an Internet retailer because after working for Wall Street, I need a change of pace and would like to work in an exciting consumer business, like Etsy.</p>

		<h2>My Experience</h2>

			<p>This is how I've evolved professionally:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Vice President,</strong> SandsPoint Capital Advisors</li> 
				<em>Dallas & NYC, July 2013-Feb 2014</em>

				<br></br>

				<li><strong>Associate,</strong> Fortress Investment Group</li>
				<em>NYC, Feb 2008-April 2012</em> 

				<br></br>
				
				<li><strong>Senior Consultant,</strong> McGladrey</li> 
				<em>Boston, Jan 2007-Feb 2008</em>

				<br></br>

				<li><strong>Senior Analyst,</strong> Goldman Sachs</li>
				<em>NYC, Oct 1996-Feb 2004</em>

			</ul>

		<h2>Education</h2>
		
			<ul>

				<li><strong>MBA,</strong> Boston University</li>
				<li><strong>BBA,</strong> Pace University</li>

			</ul>

		<h2>Other</h2>

			<p>Once I get a handle on front-end design and development, I hope to 	expand my skillset to understanding the back-end database.</p>
