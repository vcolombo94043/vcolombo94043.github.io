		<H1><EM>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</EM></H1>
		
			<P>The two different websites I chose for this design challenge were <A HREF="www.amazon.com"> Amazon</A> and <A HREF="www.squarespace.com">SquareSpace</A>.</P>

		<H1><EM>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</EM></H1>

			<H2>Amazon</H2>

				<P><STRONG><A HREF="www.amazon.com">Amazon</A></STRONG> uses positive <STRONG>space</STRONG> by covering the website with many elements.  There is some use of negative space to help draw the eye horizontally across the site. Then the use of borders draws the eye down.</P>  

				<P>Most of the objects are of the same <STRONG>size</STRONG> except for the top of the site.  That spot becomes a <strong>strong focal point</strong> that pushes a new product or special promotion.  As you proceed down, the elements are evenly sized.  At the bottom of the site, elements begin to decrease in size dramatically.  The <STRONG>balance</STRONG> of larger items to show what is for sale and smaller items for settings, helps the reader clearly visualize what is for sale and what isn't.</P>

				<P>The <STRONG>hierarchy</STRONG> on the page clearly favors the top and the left. Comparing the top items with the bottom most elements clearly demonstrates this.  The elements attributed to items for purchase number about three across.  The elements on the very bottom are links to other websites for niche services, such as <A HREF="www.6pm.com">6pm</A>. There Amazon uses columns SEVEN across and FIVE down in a small space, giving the elements at the bottom very little space or differentiation.</P>

				<P>The <STRONG>flow</STRONG> of the site is slightly serpentine.  You will notice that after the large promotion element, there are two columns: a large one on the left and a small one on the right.  Each column sections the elements in horizontal rows but the sections on both columns do not match up.  This creates a flow of moving left to right on the left column, then down on the right column.  Then the eye is drawn slightly up and to the left to review the next section down on the larger left-hand column.</P> 

				<P>The site has many sections going down with elements of similar size.  Perhaps changing the size of these elements could help to sell certain items by calling the reader's attention to them.</P>

			<H2>SquareSpace</H2>

				<P><STRONG><A HREF="www.squarespace.com">SquareSpace</A></STRONG> uses a single page format.  The site is entirely covered by a background image.  It uses changing images of an office, a restaurant, or some view through a window and makes this unfocused image the <STRONG>negative space</STRONG> upon which main elements are set.  The positive space and main <STRONG>focal point</STRONG> of the site is a tablet held by two hands showing an in-focused image of a website front page that matches the unfocused background image. The website changes the background image and the tablet's front page together. The tablet never moves as these images change, keeping the reader's eye fixated at the focal point.</P>

				<P>The <STRONG>size</STRONG> of the tablet and the headline "Better websites for all" never changes but are large enough to cover the entire center column of the page.  There is a <STRONG>balance</STRONG> between the text that is not interactive and the button that is interactive. The color of this button and text is always negative to the other text, thus creating a second focal point.  There are some text that are interactive but the <STRONG>call to action</STRONG> is clearly to  "Get Started" by clicking on the button in the center of the site. This <STRONG>balance</STRONG> between unbolded text in the center of the site and the bold text in the upper left corner demonstrates the text is interactive.  The <STRONG>hierarchy</STRONG> of this site is very subtle.  There is more than one <STRONG>focal point</STRONG> and even though there are different text features (bolding and font size), it is not hard to determine that the lower the <STRONG>hierarchy</STRONG>, the more likely the text is not interactive.</P>

				<P>A reexamination of <STRONG>balance</STRONG> leads one to the <STRONG>hierarchy</STRONG> of <STRONG>focal points</STRONG>. With the major <STRONG>focal point</STRONG> as the tablet established, perhaps there is no need for the secondary focal point of a "Get Started" button.  Clicking on the tablet could achieve the same thing.</P>

		<H1><EM>What makes them similar and different?</EM></H1>


			<P>The difference in the layouts is in the focal points.  The Amazon site wants the reader to look at each element or as many elements in one sitting, clicking on one that appeals to the reader.  SquareSpace has one major focal point and makes it obvious that it wants the reader to click on the Get Started button.</P>

		<P>However, both sites do have a primary focal point or call to action, even though there are many interactive elements.</P>
